# betterthai
Convert english character input to ipa using english pronounciation rules and then converting ipa to thai in order to type thai

As a person who is significantly better at English that his native language, and is very lazy, I complain about the horrible design of the Thai Kedmanee keyboard layout and struggle to type more than 10wpm with it. It is clear to me that this is not a problem that just affects me but a significant portion of students in Thailand that attend international school. Since I am taking Thai IB Lang&Lit A SL next year, I would be cooked if I didn't make an improved thai keyboard before the end of summer break.

The major issues that plague all current Thai keyboards is the Thai language itself, as trying to fit 60 different characters onto a keyboard designed for around 30 characters in an effecient and logical way is nearly impossible. This issue is also caused by the Thai language itself as many sounds are assosiated by more than one consonant. The Kedmandee keyboard which is pretty much the sole Thai keyboard layout that is used has a very uneven distribution of work between each finger. This further reduces efficiancy and puts extra strain on the fingers that have to do most of the work.

This is a C++ program that is designed to work with emacs and it works quite like the chinese pinyin keyboard.
